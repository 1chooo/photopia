# Lin Hugo

Hi I'm Lin Hugo, a software engineer and writer studying Computer Science at [USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) ✌️. My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing web development and improving the quality, reliability, and efficiency of large-scale software systems.

Outside of academics and work, I do streetphotography and enjoy traveling to capture unique moments and perspectives.
