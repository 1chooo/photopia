Hi, I'm Lin Hugo, a software builder and writer studying Computer Science at the [USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) ✌️. My professional interests span a broad range of topics, including web development and the pursuit of high-quality, reliable, and efficient large-scale software systems.

Outside of academics and work, I do street photography. I enjoy capturing meaningful moments through the shutter, using composition and light to explore unique perspectives and fleeting stories.

You can learn more about my work and stories through my [episodes](./episodes).
