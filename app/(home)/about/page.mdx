Hi, I'm Lin Hugo, a software builder and writer studying Computer Science at [USC Viterbi](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/).

While my professional work focuses on high-quality, large-scale software systems, my photography focuses on capturing the human touch in fleeting moments, using light and lines to construct my perspective.

The philosophy I believe:

> You are too focused on the future without realizing that today is exactly what you prayed for years ago.
